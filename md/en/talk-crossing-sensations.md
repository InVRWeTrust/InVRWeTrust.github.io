**In VR we trust: Crossing sensations**
<br><br>
Dani Ploeger's artwork The Grass Smells So Sweet offered an excellent starting point to talk with him 
and our guests, curator and art historian Johanna Neuschäffer and gallery owner and digital art expert Wolf Lieser, 
about the role of exterior space for VR and logics of representation in media. 
What are the spatial and medial relations between 'inside' and 'outside'? 
What expectations are present towards the medium of VR itself and how can these expectations be dealt with artistically?
<br><br>
Guests: Dani Ploeger (artist), Johanna Neuschäffer (Office Impart), Wolf Lieser (DAM Projects)<br/>
Recorded: Wednesday | May 12, 2021 | 6:30 – 7:45 pm
