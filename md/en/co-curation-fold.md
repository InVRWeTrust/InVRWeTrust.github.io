## Co-curation: Participating in the discourse at an early stage

The exhibition "In VR we trust" is to a large extent conceived as an occasion for discourse: On the basis of the artistic positions we would like to reflect and talk about VR(-art). Why should this discussion only begin with the opening of the exhibition? From now on we will publish notes, sketches, interviews and other fragments on this page.

Would you like to participate actively? Then we would be happy if you would join our "co-curation group":

We would like to find a group of five to fifteen people - no matter if they are artists, curators or other creative people (you just shouldn't have participated in the call). With this group we want to talk about the open call submissions from 10.10.2020 until at least 01.12.2020, share views and experiences and think together about VR (art).

Our joint discourse will be partly reflected here on our website, but will also be incorporated into the supporting programme of the four-day exhibitions. Since we are learning the process of co-curating with you, we reserve the right to make the final decision (which of course includes your thoughts and ideas) ourselves.

If this appeals to you, we would be happy if you would send us an informal e-mail with a few words about yourself and your motivation to [invrwetrust@thisisfake.team](mailto:invrwetrust@thisisfake.team).
