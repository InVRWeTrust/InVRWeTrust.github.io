Virtual Reality Installation und Audio

The question of reality and the associated power structures are central to Robin Kötzle's work. Starting from this, he deals with historical as well as capitalism-critical processes and examines the social changes in times of the digital revolution through connecting different digital media.

The VR work "Chinese Pavilion" deals critically with immersion as a historically coded interweaving of medial and colonial fictions and appropriation strategies. It consists of the 3-D scanned space of the so-called Chinese Pavilion in the park of Schloss Pillnitz near Dresden. It was built in 1808 with the aim of suggesting the immersive feeling of a stay in China. However, the means of this simulation was not a true replica of Chinese architecture, but the decoration of a European pavilion architecture with Asian elements, such as murals of Chinese landscapes and buildings.  
<br>
Only a hundred years later, the German Empire built another virtual reality in Qingdao, a new city from scratch based on German ideals. The "model colony" was governed from the governor's residence. The connecting element between China and Germany has always been economic exchange. Thus, a digital reconstruction of the residence circles around the pavilion, as at the same time the "Room of Silence" is transformed into a parcel trans-shipment center. This raises questions about the mindsets under which we conduct relationships today in the digital age. A pig, which stands for truthfulness in the Chinese horoscope, also occupies the pavilion and accompanies one at every turn. The pavilion, which repeatedly opens up to the outside, also allows a wide variety of views: of marching soldiers, as they go hand in hand with imperial power and political representation, of the nature that surrounds the pavilion, or of facades that provide the opportunity to look into the distance. From time to time, stone quivers, fragments detached from the historical architecture, fly through the space and a feeling of something fantastic remains.

The arbitrary, palimpsest-like superimposition of fiction and reality, present and past, is matched by virtual reality, which randomly reconfigures itself again and again. While the pavilion belongs to a place both digitally and analogously, the bodies of the viewers remain disconnected and reduced to mere sight. Thus, the VR work "Chinese Pavilion" is likewise concerned with overcoming certain temporal-spatial distances by transferring the analog into the digital, while at the same time also making visible the ruptures of these transformations and translation processes and ultimately investigating the modes of operation of transcultural appropriation processes. In this way, the Chinese Pavilion questions not only today's Virtual Reality, but vision in general. Moreover, VR does not dwell on a media experience, but investigates how appropriation processes function through virtual realities and are reproduced even today.
