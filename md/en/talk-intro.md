**Next dates: Talks with the artists and guests on May 11 & 12 (live)**

Starting from the four artworks in our exhibition, we would like to talk about individual aspects of VR and art. We have been able to attract exciting guests who will discuss together with the artists and us on the two evenings.<br/>
<br/>
All talks will be held in English, will last 70-75 minutes and can be streamed live on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/invrwetrust).<br/>
