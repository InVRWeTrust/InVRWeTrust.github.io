In hindsight, it may be possible to say that over the course of thousands of years 
it became increasingly obvious that the architecture that surrounds us has a 
decisive influence on the way we interact with each other. 
Public places enabled or prevented encounters, palaces were stormed, 
meetings were held in theaters, buildings for one type of person and 
other buildings for another type were built in dedicated parts of the cities. 
In which rooms do we meet now? To whom do these rooms belong and what references 
and preconditions do we accept quietly or thoughtlessly?
