**In VR we trust: A matter of course**
<br><br>
The work Chinese Pavilion was our occasion and inspiration to discuss with the artist of the work Robin Kötzle and the gallery owner and expert for digital art Wolf Lieser. 
The focus was on the current and future significance of VR art.
What modes of action and forms of representation can be discerned and what does art in, with and through VR look like, in which the 'newness' of the medium no longer plays a special role?

Guests: Robin Kötzle (artist) & Wolf Lieser (DAM Projects)<br/>
Recorded: Wednesday | May 12, 2021 | 8:00 – 9:15 pm
