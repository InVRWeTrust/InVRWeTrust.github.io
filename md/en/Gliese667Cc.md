Elena Romenkova (1986) from St.Petersburg Russia. In 2009 she graduated from Pedagogical Universitet a faculty of Fine Arts in St.Petersburg. Since 2004 she has been constantly participating in art exhibitions all over the World. After getting a classical art education she continued to develop in the field of 3D digital art and glitch art became the main interest. Glitch arises from data manipulation methods and brings a new aesthetic and a new art style. Since 2017 she lives and works in Austria.

“Gliese 667 Cc” -is a digital space, a new way to experience artworks. This is a virtual exhibition, which presents glitch sculptures, animations, and still images.  
The sculptures here are developed and transformed through 3D modeling processes and/or changes in the data structure with manipulation processes. Glitch brings unpredictable results. The shape transformations give to the 3D sculptures a new aesthetic and meaning.  
The 3D world opens up a new dimension, a parallel world that exists in its own laws. The glitch bends time and space, creating a new aesthetic from this destruction.

The idea was to create a new kind of space in a virtual world for performing digital art. The immersion in a virtual exhibition allows perceiving an art object in a new way. Virtual Reality gives a new kind of sensation. Here everything is perceived differently than in real life, the sizes of objects, the depth and height of space, and also time. Music, as a separate art object, makes this experience brighter. A traditional way of art perception becomes in a virtual world a new meaning. The virtual world dissolves physical borders and limits.
