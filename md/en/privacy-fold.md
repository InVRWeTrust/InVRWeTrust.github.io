## Privacy Policy

### What personal data we collect and why we collect it

Our website can be used without providing personal data. No personal data is collected. For the quantitative measurement of accesses, only anonymous data about the accesses is saved in log files (the shortened and thus anonymized IP address of the inquirer; name of the file accessed; date and time of the access; notification whether the access was successful). It is therefore not possible to draw conclusions about specific persons.


### Embedded content from other websites

This site embeds contents from third party websites.  
Embedded content from other websites, when enabled, behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.  
These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.  
You can choose whether and which of these embedded contents will be loaded [below](#dataConsent).
