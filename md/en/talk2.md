**In VR we trust: Moving in space**
<br><br>
The artwork Gliese 667 Cc shall serve as the starting point of our discussion to discuss art spaces in VR with Elena Romenkova as well as our other guests, cognitive scientist and artist Hannah Fitsch and Venice VR curator and cultural creator Michel Reilhac. How do we perceive the space around us in VR? How do we move around in VR? What spaces exist in VR and how is the potential of virtual spaces used?

Guests: Elena Romenkova (artist), Hannah Fitsch (TU Berlin / Museums Queeren) & Michel Reilhac (Venice VR / Venice Biennale College Cinema and Cinema VR)
