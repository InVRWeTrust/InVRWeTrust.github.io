### Frequently asked questions

**What is a cardboard?**
A Cardboard is a virtual reality headset made of cardboard into which your smartphone is inserted as a display. It's an inexpensive way to view VR art at home with certain restrictions.

**Does your exhibition work with my smartphone?**
Most likely yes. To play the 360Â° videos on the Cardboard, you need the YouTube app on Android and iOS. On Android you also need the Cardboard app. Don't worry, we will give you installation instructions at the beginning of the exhibition.  
If your cell phone is very old and you don't know whether it is powerful enough, you can test whether it can play [this video](https://youtu.be/XPhmpfiWEEw) smoothly. To do this, you have to open the video in the YouTube app (not in the browser) and then click the cardboard symbol <object data="./graphics/google-cardboard.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="24" height="13">

**I don't have a smartphone. Can I still see the exhibition?**
Unfortunately, no. But maybe you know someone who can lend you a device?

**Can I also use the cardboard with glasses or contact lenses?**
With contact lenses it works without any problems. With glasses, the cardboard often doesn't sit quite as comfortably and depending on the glasses it is sometimes a bit blurry, but in principle it also works.

**Can I use my existing cardboard?**
Yes, but we recommend ordering an "In VR we trust" cardboard in order to be able to fully participate in the exhibition.
If you would like to participate from outside of Germany (or if the "In VR we trust" Cardboard is no longer available) go to this website from May 5th, 2021 to get to the exhibition: [doubt.invr.info](https://doubt.invr.info)

**Can I also use my HTC / Vive / Oculus?**
No, our exhibition is designed exclusively for Cardboard.
