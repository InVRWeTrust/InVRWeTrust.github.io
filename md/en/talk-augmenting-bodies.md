**In VR we trust: Augmenting bodies**
<br><br>
Based on the exploration of the artwork Virtualshamanism, we discussed bodies, their functions and 
possibilities in artistic VR environments with Matias Brunacci, the dancer and scientist Einav Katan-Schmid 
and the Venice VR curator and cultural creator Michel Reilhac. 
How do we perceive our own bodies in VR and how is our body perception and body memory used and changed by the medium?
<br><br>
Guests: Matias Brunacci (artist), Einav Katan-Schmid (gamelab.berlin / HU Berlin) & Michel Reilhac (Venice VR / Venice Biennale College Cinema and Cinema VR)<br/>
Recorded: Tuesday | May 11, 2021 | 6:30 â€“ 7:45 pm
