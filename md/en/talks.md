**Recordings: Talks with the artists and guests on May 11 & 12 (live)**

Starting from the four artworks in our exhibition, we talked about individual aspects of VR and art. We have been able to attract exciting guests who discussed together with the artists and us on the two evenings.<br/>

All talks were held in English, have a duration of 65-75 minutes and can be listened again on our site â†“
