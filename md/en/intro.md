Do you also want to ride on the virtual reality hypetrain? Do you dream of a mixture of *pew-pew* special effects and empathising, euphoric experiences? Do you believe in VR? Do you believe in immersion? Do you believe in the breakthrough that VR will have as a new medium in our society?

<br><br>
The two-part exhibition, planned for the NRW Forum in Düsseldorf and the Nudel in Zeitz, aims to reflect on the current status and future value of virtual reality as an artistic tool or medium on the basis of four critical positions and at the same time to enable a public discussion about it.
<br><br>
Due to the effects of the pandemic and the uncertain situation for visitors to the exhibition, we decided not to hold the exhibition in the planned venues in Düsseldorf and Zeitz. Instead, a postal-virtual adaptation will open on May 5th, 2021. To be notified as soon as the admission package can be ordered, sign up for [our newsletter](#subscribe-fold)!
