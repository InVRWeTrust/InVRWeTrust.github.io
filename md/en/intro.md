Do you also want to ride on the virtual reality hypetrain? Do you dream of a mixture of *pew-pew* special effects and empathising, euphoric experiences? Do you believe in VR? Do you believe in immersion? Do you believe in the breakthrough that VR will have as a new medium in our society?

The two-part exhibition at the NRW Forum in Düsseldorf and at the Nudel in Zeitz aims to reflect on the current status and future value of virtual reality as an artistic tool or medium on the basis of four critical positions and at the same time to enable a public discussion about it.

"In VR we trust", curated by [Daniel Hengst](http://danielhengst.de/) & [Clemens Schöll](http://neopostmodern.com/), 
a project of [THIS IS FAKE](http://thisisfake.team/), in cooperation with [plusnull e.V.](http://www.plusnull.org/), 
supported by the [innogy foundation](https://innogy-stiftung.com/).

On this website we will collect conversations, sketches, excerpts of the curatorial process and relevant links for a critical examination of VR.
